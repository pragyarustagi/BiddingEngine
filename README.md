BIDDING ENGINE FRAMEWORK 
 
The bidding engine framework required a set of APIs that could foster the development of scalable and concurrent bidding engine in future. To build this API, I have used “Django REST Framework” which is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. In order to build the APIs, we need to install the following: 
1. Django=1.8 
2. Djangorestframework=3.1.1 
3. Pytz=2018.5 
 
To run this project, follow the following steps: 
 
1. Get inside project directory – Bidding 
2. virtualenv env 
3. source env/bin/activate 
4. pip install -r requirements.txt 
5. python manage.py runserver
